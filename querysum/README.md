In this experiment we used [QuerySum](https://github.com/yumoxu/querysum) model, and [TD-QFS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X1rKKP5SrUoU9-ki0urrlhO_L35Vl2oO/view?usp=sharing) data set. Instead of using the query from the data set, we used our generated query and performed the QFS using QuerySum model.

QuerySum model is available [here](https://github.com/yumoxu/querysum).

Use 'EvidenceGenerationFor_tdqfs.ipynb' file to generate the query for TD-QFS data set. We used the same documents as the author used for generating their queries. Then replace them on 'data/tdqfs/query_info.txt'. Finally, follow the steps on querysum model to get the results.
